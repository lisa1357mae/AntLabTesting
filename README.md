# AntLabTesting
This is a react-native ios testing Application for Anthroware/AntLab Developers to drop in and test our own NPM packages.

It contains two simple screens using react-navigation.

Simply run: react-native run-ios
in your terminal after cloning (assuming you have a mobile environment set up already.

If not, follow the directions here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

Use NVM 8.10.0


Note for our Developers: Packages can easily be added and removed and should always be removed after testing is complete.
Happy Coding! ðŸ’› Lisa Mae
