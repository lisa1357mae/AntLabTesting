# AntLabTesting
This is a react-native ios testing Application for Anthroware/AntLab Developers to drop in and test our own NPM packages. 

It contains two simple screens using react-navigation. 

Simply run: react-native run-ios 
in your terminal after cloning (assuming you have a mobile environment set up already. 

If not, follow the directions here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started 


The Anthroware Development team is transferring some useful components, built by our team, from our BitBucket account to our new open source project on GitHub/NPM.
Note for our Developers: Packages can easily be added and removed and should always be removed after testing is complete. 
Happy Coding! ðŸ’› Lisa Mae
